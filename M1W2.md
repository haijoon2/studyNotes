# Data Types & Objects

## [ Primitive Data Types ]

### * Six Primitive Data Types (in JS)
- (1) undefined
- (2) null
- (3) boolean
- (4) string
- (5) number
- (6) symbol
* in JavaScript, all values which are NOT OBJECTS are collevtively referred to as primitives.

### * Objects ARE NOT Primitives
- Anything not in above list (ex. a Date) is an Object. 
- Objects are NOT PRIMITIVE data types. (arrays & functions are technically a sub-category of objects).
- Objects (including arrays, functions & other types of objects) have properties.

## [ Objects - Basic Concepts]
### * Object Literal
- some values can be represented by <i>literals</i>
  - string literals : "lighthouse"
  - number literals : 5 and 7.5
  - arrays have a literal syntax using [square brackets]: [1, 2, 3] is 3-element array
  - objects have a literal syntax using {braces}
    ```javascript
    const emptyObject = {};
     ```
  - object literal with a single key-value pair:
    ```javascript
    const tinyobject = { "size": "Tiny" };
    ```
    Above object has a single key (the string "size") associated with a value (the string "Tiny").
  - Rewrite above code:
    ```javascript
    const tinyObject = { size: "Tiny" };
    ```
    Although our key "size" is encloed in double quotes like a string, it can still be considered a string without the quotes around it.

### * Objects are Like 2-Column Tables
