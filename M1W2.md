# Data Types & Objects

## [ Primitive Data Types ]

### * Six Primitive Data Types (in JS)
- (1) undefined
- (2) null
- (3) boolean
- (4) string
- (5) number
- (6) symbol
* in JavaScript, all values which are NOT OBJECTS are collevtively referred to as primitives.

### * Objects ARE NOT Primitives
- Anything not in above list (ex. a Date) is an Object. 
- Objects are NOT PRIMITIVE data types. (arrays & functions are technically a sub-category of objects).
- Objects (including arrays, functions & other types of objects) have properties.

### * Seven Fundamental types of the JavaScript

## [ Objects - Basic Concepts]
### * Object Literal
- some values can be represented by <i>literals</i>
  - string literals : "lighthouse"
  - number literals : 5 and 7.5
  - arrays have a literal syntax using [square brackets]: [1, 2, 3] is 3-element array
  - objects have a literal syntax using {braces}
    ```javascript
    const emptyObject = {};
     ```
  - object literal with a single key-value pair:
    ```javascript
    const tinyobject = { "size": "Tiny" };
    ```
    Above object has a single key (the string "size") associated with a value (the string "Tiny").
  - Rewrite above code:
    ```javascript
    const tinyObject = { size: "Tiny" };
    ```
    Although our key "size" is encloed in double quotes like a string, it can still be considered a string without the quotes around it.

### * Objects are Like 2-Column Tables
- Objects allow us to easily access the values (in the 2nd column) via quick reference to their respective keys (in the 1st colum).

### * Object Values
- An object's values can be of ANY TYPE.
  ```javascript
  const myObject = {
    a: 6,       // Number
    b: "abc",   // String
    c: true,    // Boolean
    d: null,    // Null
  };
  ```

### * Accessing Object Values
- to retrieve a value within an object, use [square-bracket] notation.
  ```javascript
  const person = { firstName: "Khurram"};
  const firstName = person["firstName"]; // get the value associated with the key "firstName"
  ```

  ```javascript
  const person = { 
    firstName: "Khurram", 
    lastName: "Kim", 
    age: 45, 
    ethnicity: "Asian"
  };


  (1) const firstName = person["firstName"]; // Khurram // rarely used

  (2) const lastName = person.lastName; // Kim // commonly used
  
  (3) const key = "age" // commonly used when keys are dynamic or hidden
      const age = person[key]
  ```
